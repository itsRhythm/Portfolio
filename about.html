				<h4>
					About
				</h4>
				<p class="large">
					Hi, I’m Rhythm. I'm a tech enthusiast with over 1 year of experience in Web developement.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can also call me a problem solver, data-analyst and critical thinker.
				</p>
				<p>
					I don’t like to define myself by the work I’ve done. I define myself by the work I want to do. Skills can be taught, personality is inherent. I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself, and do interesting things that matter.
				</p>
				<p>
					Fueled by high energy levels and boundless enthusiasm, I’m easily inspired and more then willing to follow my fascinations wherever they take me. I’m passionate, expressive, multi-talented spirit with a natural ability to entertain and inspire. I’m never satisfied to just come up with ideas. Instead I have an almost impulsive need to act on them.
				</p>
				<p>
					My abundant energy fuels me in the pursuit of many interests, hobbies, areas of study and artistic endeavors. I’m a fast learner, able to pick up new skills and juggle different projects and roles with relative ease.
				</p>
